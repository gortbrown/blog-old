    <h1>The Old Computer Challenge Part 1: Planning My Setup</h1>
    <notice>
    <p>One night while I was scrolling through Mastodon instead of going to bed (something I wish I could say didn&#39;t
        happen often) I came accross a new challenge that piqued my interest. It&#39;s called <a
            href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-06-04-old-computer-challenge-v3.html">The Old Computer
            Challenge</a>. The idea behind it is to see how well you can do using an old computer as your main computer
        for a week. Apparently in the past, this meant actually using old systems or limiting other things that were
        harder to limit in the 2020s. But the challenge for this year is interesting. For one week, you have to use a
        computer (old or new) that is limited to a single CPU core, 512mb of RAM, and the lowest CPU clock speed
        possible. I decided to give this a shot since it&#39;s summer for me, and the only thing I really use my main
        laptop for is basic entertainment and checking emails, and the stuff where I really need a fairly capable
        machine is for work, and is therefore done on my work laptop. The only question is, how am I going to do this?
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
    <p>So as you can probably guess from what I said above, I will be using my main laptop, the Framework Laptop 13 with
        a Core i5, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, which is split between Debian 12 and Windows 11. So yeah, definitely a
        far cry from the humble specs layed out in the challenge. Luckilly, it is possible to limit these specs in the
        BIOS to acomplish this on whatever hardware I want. The hard part, however, will be the software.</p>
    <h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3>
    <p>It&#39;s safe to say that Windows 11 probably won&#39;t be the OS of choice here, (a blessing in disguise? XD) so
        Linux it is. I thought about some BSD derivative, but from what I remember it doesn&#39;t support my wireless
        card, so that unfortunately makes it a no-go for me, as I don&#39;t have an ethernet connection anywhere but
        right by my router in the living room, and I don&#39;t want to tether myself to the livingroom floor for a week
        if I want to access the web. Anyway, I still might have to choose a bit wisely as 512MB of RAM is a bit
        restrictive even for some Linux systems. My plan to find a distro that will work is to try them in a VM with the
        restrictions in question. I think Debian 12 with a lighter desktop environment should suffice, but if not, it
        shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find something. As for programs, I don&#39;t think the hardware restrictions will
        cause much of a problem since most of what I do can be done in a web browser or a text editor, with the
        exception of Rocket League, which I can either do without for a week or download on my Switch. </p>
    <p>I will try working things out, and as I plan and participate in the challenge, I will post here about it, as I
        think this will be a fun challenge to participate in. If you are interested in participating yourself, you can
