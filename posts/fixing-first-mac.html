<h1>Fixing my First Mac Part 1: Before the Fix</h1>
<notice>
<p>I&#39;ve never owned a Mac. My family was always a big Windows family, and I followed suit until I got into Linux, then I became a Linux user. But I never extensively used a Mac until about a year and a half ago when I got an old MacBook Pro for my IT job. Before that, I had only used Macs a little bit for school. But even after starting the job, I never had one to just mess around with the same way I would mess around with any other computer I own. </p>
<p>But recently, my Brother&#39;s roommate moved out and left behind an old iMac he didn&#39;t want. Knowing I loved old tech, my brother messaged me asking if I wanted it, and of course, I said yes. He said it didn&#39;t work, but I figured I could either fix it, or salvage the parts to use or sell. But to me and my brother&#39;s surprise, it actually booted up! But of course, there are a few issues I am going to fix before it becomes something I would consider solid.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-imac">About the iMac</h2>
<p>After a bit of research, I found out that this is a late 2011 21.5 inch iMac with an Intel Core i3, 2 GB of RAM, and a 250GB HDD. If that sounds to you like it would be slow, it is. The only way I&#39;ve gotten anything to run decently is by running Zorin OS Lite with the Mate desktop, and even then, the small amount of RAM limits how much I can really do. But other than that, everything works really well! Definitely not replacing my Framework Laptop as my main PC by any means, but after some upgrades, it will definitely replace the old desktop I had, which had a Pentium, and was literally just a laptop motherboard in an old case.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades-people-upgrades-">Upgrades people, upgrades!</h2>
<p>There are two upgrades I am planning on making: adding more RAM, and replacing the hard drive with an SSD. Luckily, the memory is easily accessible through a door at the bottom of the display, and I&#39;ve replaced SSDs in iMacs at work before, so it shouldn&#39;t be too hard. I even have a spare SSD lying around I can use.</p>
<p>Of course, the issue comes with how to access the HDD inside the iMac, which is done by removing the screen, which is held on by adhesive. And while it&#39;s easy to remove, the adhesive kind of stops working after taking it off, so I&#39;d need to get some of that as well as the new RAM. </p>
<p>All in all, I&#39;m pretty excited about getting this working better! I&#39;ve always thought old Macs were pretty nice. They mixed that high quality build with less of the repairability issues and other compromises. It will be nice to get it to the point that I can use this without any issues!</p>
