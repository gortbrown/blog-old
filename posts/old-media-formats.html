    <notice>
    <p>I&#39;ve always had a fond spot for old tech. There&#39;s something cool about seeing how tech worked and how
        people interacted with it that. And every time I see this old tech, I wonder what it would be like to use it.
        That&#39;s why I like projects like SpaceHey, which recreates MySpace, or NeoCities, which recreates the idea of
        GeoCitties. I&#39;ve also found myself getting more into traditional media formats as well, like radio and
        traditional TV.</p>
    <p>I&#39;m on summer break right now, and I also work a remote IT job, meaning that I have a lot of time to kill
        while stuff isn&#39;t happening. This has mostly been filled up by streaming TV shows. Though as I&#39;ve
        streamed more, I&#39;ve gotten more bored. Sometimes you run out of stuff to watch, and having to find something
        to fill that gap can be a bit of a daunting task. </p>
    <p>Of course, sometimes that just means it&#39;s time to switch over to music or podcasts, but sometimes you can
        fall into the same rut of trying to find something if you&#39;ve listened to all of your podcasts or music. And
        of course, picking up a book and reading can solve this too, but there&#39;s also these older media formats to
        fall back on.</p>
    <h2 id="it-s-like-tv-but-the-internet-">It&#39;s like TV, but the internet!</h2>
    <p>Everyone and their dog seems to have some sort of free TV-style streaming service nowadays. Samsung has one
        included with their TVs, SlingTV has a free option, Amazon Prime has FreeVee, etc. Seeing as my mom used to have
        a Sling subscription and the app was already on my TV, I used that.</p>
    <p>I find it pretty nice to be able to go back to the channel format. Sure, you still have to choose what channel,
        but it allows you to just see what&#39;s on and choose based on that. It also gives me the chance to see shows I
        might not have been exposed to before. For example, I had never seen Alf before outside of one Mr. Robot
        episode, but I started watching a channel dedicated to Alf, and it&#39;s a pretty good show!</p>
    <h2 id="radio-on-and-off-the-internet-">Radio on (and off) the internet!</h2>

    <p>I&#39;ve also started listening more to the radio, either through my car&#39;s radio, or through radio.net. I
        listened to the radio a lot as a kid in my parents&#39; cars on the way to school, and on my radio alarm clock,
        so it felt nice to start listening to old stations I used to listen to, as well as some new ones in town since I
        no longer live in the same area I did all those years ago.</p>
    <p>I think it&#39;s fun to look back on the tech that brought us to where we are today. I also think that sometimes
        it&#39;s nice to go back and use that old tech to take a breather from the issues with today&#39;s tech.</p>
