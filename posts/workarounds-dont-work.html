    <h1>Workarounds Don't Work for Everyone</h1>
    <notice>
    <p>It&#39;s summer vacation for me, and that means I spend a lot of time while doing remote IT stuff watching YouTube videos in the background, and reading tech articles online. As I am a big Linux nerd, I have seen a lot of articles and videos about Linux, and about the end of life for Windows 10 since that&#39;s been a bit of breaking news in the past month. But along with some of these articles and videos, I have seen a lot of responses criticising their choices. A lot of them have summed up to &quot;Well why didn&#39;t you just do this. It&#39;s a pretty easy workaround to solve this problem.&quot; And I get it, some of those people were probably well-wishers just trying to help out. I don&#39;t really have any issue with them. I do take issue, however, with the people who posted those comments in a very &quot;what an idiot&quot; kind of tone. This is a friendly reminder to those people, as well as just anyone else listening: not everyone want&#39;s to do some janky workaround to get things working for them.</p>
<p>There are two pieces in question that have fueled this thought in my head: an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/06/08/bye-bye-ubuntu-hello-manjaro-how-did-we-get-here/">article</a> written by Jenny List on Hackaday, and a <a href="https://youtu.be/aYzrn--CEtc">video</a> made by CHM Tech on YouTube about the Windows 10 end-of-life. </p>
<p>In the article, titled <em>Bye Bye Ubuntu, Hello Manjaro. How Did We Get Here?</em> List talkes about the fact that she switched to Manjaro from Ubuntu, and her reasons for doing so. Specifically, she didn&#39;t like the fact that Ubuntu had gotten slower, specifically when it came to the use of Snaps for a lot of the packages. A lot of the comments were friendly conversation about the topic, but some criticized her decisions. Specifically, some asked why she was even using snap in the first place, suggesting she just uninstall it, or just use the deb packages. Of course, some people replied mentioning that some programs like Firefox were moved to Snaps, which got countered with mention of a workaround using PPAs. Now of course these workarounds aren&#39;t all that hard to do if you know what you are doing, and List seems like she is fairly savy when it comes to tech, but that doesn&#39;t automatically mean that she, or really anyone else, is just fine with a &quot;workaround.&quot; In the article, List mentions that she wants her computer to just work, and be fairly reliable since it&#39;s what she does a lot of her work on. As good as a workaround might be, it still usually isn&#39;t perfect. I haven&#39;t explored this PPA workaround myself, but I&#39;d imagine it comes with a few potential problems, making it less than ideal for a reliable &quot;just works&quot; system.</p>
<p>Another example is in the video, titled <em>WINDOWS 10 EoL Reactions: 2025 The Year of Linux?</em> It&#39;s a follow up to another video he did on the topic, where he responds to the comments on the previous video. In the previous video, he talks about how the Windows 10 end of life could negatively affect a lot of people with hardware that doesn&#39;t meet the minimum Windows 11 requirements. He didn&#39;t end up mentioning the workarounds that exist to get Windows 11 working on that older hardware, and for good reason. But a lot of people in the comments called him out for that, talking about how easy it was, and how it meant that the problems in this video didn&#39;t exist. One even commented &quot;I can&#39;t believe people don&#39;t know how to put win 11 on older systems.&quot; That one I think would immediately put things into perspective for most people. The reason most people don&#39;t know how is because they aren&#39;t a part of the tech community, and more importantly, wouldn&#39;t want to deal with a workaround just to get the latest software (which in a lot of peoples&#39; opinions isn&#39;t that good, or isn&#39;t really different enough to care.) Plus, this workaround can still cause issues if the hardware isn&#39;t officially supported, breaking peoples&#39; systems. </p>
<p>I think the takeaway from this should be to remember that workarounds aren&#39;t the same as an actual solution. They&#39;re literally just ways someone found to get something to <em>work</em> by getting <em>around</em> the stuff that makes it not work. It&#39;s a hack. An ineligant solution made to get something to work in a way it normally wasn&#39;t supposed to. And while some people are ok with that, a lot aren&#39;t. I think it&#39;s easy to forget when you are in the tech/hacker community that most people just want their systems to work withoug having to tinker around with it to get it to perfection. We sometimes need to remember that we think of computers in a completely different way than the average person, and so some of the things we might see as an acceptible solution to a problem might not be acceptible for the average user, because they just want their system to work without having to think about implementing some workaround. And thats fine! That&#39;s how I treat my main laptop, and I&#39;m a technically savy user. I just need something that works rather than finding some workaround. It&#39;s the whole reason I keep around a Windows 11 partition rather than running it and Visual Studio 2022 (for my classes and a few projects) in a virtual machine. And if you are fine with a hacky workaround solution, there&#39;s no issue with that! Just remember that that doesn&#39;t work for everyone, tech savy or not.</p>
