    <h1>Google Locking Up the Web with DRM</h1>
    <p>The internet is changing in lots of ways. With companies like Twitter (or I guess X now?) and Reddit making controvercial changes in the interest in making a boatload of money, AI models inching their ways into every inch of our world and governments all around the world trying more than ever to block websites that threaten their interests, the web is looking a lot different now than it did even 5 years ago. You may not find too much issue with it, but lots of people don&#39;t like where things are going.</p>
<p>Adding to this, Google is working on something that I and many others believe will negatively effect the internet. It&#39;s called <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity">Web Environment Integrity</a>, and it will essentially apply the same digital restrictions we see with movies and music (Digital Rights Management or DRM) to the entirety of the internet, including restricting how we access it, and the tools we use to remove some of the worse elements of it.</p>
<h2 id="drm-applied-to-the-web">DRM applied to the web</h2>
<p>As a quick explaination of what DRM is for those who don&#39;t know what that is, it is a technology that is applied to digital media such as movies and music that is meant to prevent piracy, but also restricts things so much that it has the potential to punish people who bought the content legally. If you&#39;ve ever owned a movie, but you could only watch it on certain devices or apps, you&#39;ve been screwed over by DRM. Imagine this, but applied to the web</p>
<h2 id="what-is-google-doing-">What is Google doing?</h2>
<p>Web Environment Integrity basically looks to provide a sense of trust to the web. It would allow any website that implements it to restrict which clients can access the site. This means that if your web browser or whatever app you are using to access the site is considered a &quot;trusted client&quot; then it can access the site. Otherwise, it won&#39;t be able to. This all sounds good enough on it&#39;s own, but it introduces a number of issues that have the potential to restrict peoples&#39; digital freedoms on the internet. </p>
<p>Lets look at the trusted client bit for a second. This means that a browser has to implement the technology to be trusted by websites that also implement it. Since Google also owns Chrome, this presents the risk of making Chrome and other browsers based on it (like Edge) the only browsers that are &quot;trusted,&quot; basically making them the only browsers you can use. This is concerning because it gives Google the power to shut out the competition as far as browsers go, and it also shows just how much control Google has over something that is supposed to be open and not controlled by any single entity. </p>
<p>Of course, there is the potential that other browsers could implement this, but most aren&#39;t keen on stuff that restricts digital rights on the web. Firefox for example fights for an open web, which Web Environment Integrity goes against. This snuffs out any Firefox based browsers, including ones that are made to help people get around censorship from oppressive governments.</p>
<p>Finally, this will affect certain extensions that block ads and trackers for the sake of privacy. While this is a win for those who rely on ads for revenue, it will also remove protections from trackers that collect more data than they should, as well as ads that contain malware. Going back to the browsers that wouldn&#39;t implement this, there are many browsers like Brave and DuckDuckGo that would never allow this due to the privacy hit, thus eliminating them as an option for browsing the web.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-affect-me-">How does this affect me?</h2>
<p>To make this easy, I will split this into three bits for three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who use something that isn&#39;t Chrome</li>
<li>People who use ad and tracker blockers</li>
<li>People who just use use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: For the sake of simplicity, Chrome will also refer to Edge since they are based on the same code</p>
<h3 id="people-who-don-t-use-chrome">People who don&#39;t use Chrome</h3>
<p>For anyone who uses a browser that isn&#39;t Chrome, such as Firefox, Brave or DuckDuckGo, then your browser is at risk of being denied access to certain sites on the internet unless they implement Web Environment Integrity. And if they do implement it, they would do so at the cost of digital freedom privacy, as they would be implementing something that would render ad and tracker blockers that&#39;s made by a company who&#39;s entire business model is based around collecting user data. </p>
<h3 id="people-who-use-ad-and-tracker-blockers">People who use ad and tracker blockers</h3>
<p>As touched on above, this will essentially render any ad blockers and tracker blockers useless. While anyone who earns revenue from ads will like this for legitimate reasons, it also poses an issue for those who use these tools for the sake of privacy, and to help protect themselves from malvertising.</p>
<h3 id="people-who-just-use-chrome">People who just use Chrome</h3>
<p>Lets say you are one of the many users who just use Chrome. In that case, chances are you won&#39;t be affected much if at all. However, that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will be in the same boat. This will affect people who choose to use different browsers by rendering their choice basically useless, and will be a big blow to the people fighting for privacy on the internet. More importantly, this can affect people who rely on browsers like Tor to evade censorship, or to stay safe in cases like activists doing their work to improve the world, or sources speaking with the press about sensitive topics.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-point">The final point</h2>
<p>Google&#39;s initiative sounds like it would be a good thing on the surface, but just like most DRM systems, while it solves some problems, it introduces much bigger problems that outweigh the benefits by a lot. Therefore, I ask that everyone fight to keep the internet the open place it was meant to be, and speak out against this flawed initiative.</p>
<h2 id="let-me-know-your-thoughts">Let me know your thoughts</h2>
<p>I want to hear what you think about this! Let me know what you think by contacting me at the email address on my main page <a href="https://saladhax.site">https://saladhax.site</a>, on Mastodon @gortbrown@fosstodon.org or on Threads @gortbrown.</p>
<p>If you know a lot about this topic, and see something that I got wrong, or have a point I forgot to mention or mentioned poorly, feel free to let me know! I&#39;d rather be corrected if I&#39;m wrong than just assume I am right.</p>
