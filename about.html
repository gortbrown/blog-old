        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/me.png" width="200px" style="margin: 0 auto; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; border-radius: 30px;">
        <notice>Hello! I'm Garrett Brown! I live in the Midwest region of the United States. I am a cybersecurity and computer science major at Kansas State University, and an IT Manager at Collegian Media Group. I am a big fan of computers, (especially when it's retro and FOSS related,) music, Japanese culture, and running/hiking. You can learn a bit more about me below!</notice>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <notice>
            <h4>Tinkering/Hacking with Computers</h4>
            Big surprise, I love messing with computers! I like trying to fix and find uses for old computers and devices, messing with open hardware like the PinePhone and PineTime, and working on small coding projects on the side. I also like learning pen testing skills through TryHackMe and testing my skills on personal lab setups.\

            <h4>Running, biking and camping</h4>
