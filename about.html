        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Garrett Brown! I am a cybersecurity and computer science major at Kansas State University, and an IT Manager at Collegian Media Group.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <h4>Tinkering/Hacking with Computers</h4>
        <p>Big surprise, I love messing with computers! I like trying to fix and find uses for old computers and devices, messing with open hardware like the PinePhone and PineTime, and working on small coding projects on the side. I also like learning pen testing skills through TryHackMe and testing my skills on personal lab setups.</p>
        <h4>Band</h4>
        <p>I am a trombonist in the Kansas State Marching Band and CatBand. I am also a brother of the Epsilon Pi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi, the honorary band fraternity.</p>
        <h4>Anime and Manga</h4>
        <p>I am also big into watching anime and reading manga. Some of my favorite series to watch and read are Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, Dr. Stone, One Piece and Attack on Titan.</p>
        <h4>Running, biking and camping</h4>
        <p>While I have fallen out of it since starting college, I love going on runs, riding my bike around town/campus and going on the occasional camping trip with friends. </p>
